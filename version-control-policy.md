## Branches

- The `master` branch is the default branch for any non-breaking changes.
- The `dev` branch is the target branch for breaking changes.

## XYDS support policy
XYDS design-system provide support for particular version till one year from **major** release date. For the version, like  x.x.0.x eg. 2.0.0.1.  The styling and bugs in existing components will only be accepted until one for major release components.

## XYDS design-system Release Schedule and Versioning

XYDS design-system follows a 2-week release cycle. We expect to have 2 - 4 major releases per year containing breaking changes.
Any other interim releases will be patch or minor releases including any non-breaking changes.

By having a lower rate of releases with breaking changes, we will decrease the amount of overhead that users experience trying to upgrade.

## Release Types

In summary, XYDS design-system has the following types of releases:

* **Major release:** A release with new features and breaking changes; this revs the major version number (e.g. 2.0.0)
* **Minor release:** A release with non breaking changes including new features and/or bugfixes; this revs the minor version number (e.g. 1.1.0)
* **Patch release:** A release consisting primarily of bugfixes, with no features or breaking changes; this revs the patch version number (e.g. 1.0.1)
* **Pre-release:** A preview release containing breaking changes, cut before the next scheduled major release (e.g. 2.0.0-0)
